# Android Application 

I recently started to teach my self android programming development. Although I had experience in developing this type of apps, working with Android studio is something else and absolutely worth to explore it. 

In this app I use basic functions such as connecting different activities, running API's and web view page in Android OP. I also experinence material design in this envirnment which quite challenging and takes lots of time to function. i use various libraries you can find them in Gradle.build.

I would appreiate if you can contibute to this app.
